# Agents External Stubs

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/_latestVersion)

Agents External Stubs is the primary stub you need to run and test Agent Services locally and in other stubbed environments. 
It replaces gg-stubs and agents-stubs together with auth, company-auth-frontend, enrolment-store-proxy, tax-enrolments, users-groups-search, citizen-details, DES and even datastream. 

You will have to run [UI stubs](https://github.com/hmrc/agents-external-stubs-frontend) as well in order to be able to sign-in seamlessly into your application.

This app SHOULD NOT be run on QA nor Production environment.

## Principles

- dynamic (data can be changed, no initial data included)
- persistent (data are persisted until modified or removed)
- programmable (data can be created and retrieved entirely through the custom API)
- smart (only minimal input needed, sensibly auto-generates missing values)
- complete (feels and behaves like real API would)
- multi-tenant (test data are sandboxed into planets, multiple data planets can co-exist)
- self-contained (does not need any other services to run)
- easy-to-use (through ergonomic API and complementary UI frontend)

## How requests are handled?

We handle local requests gracefully and do not require existing applications to reconfigure, i.e. we provide necessary TCP proxies:

- listening on 8500 for auth requests
- listening on 9978 for user-details requests
- listening on 9337 for citizen-details requests
- listening on 9984 for users-groups-search requests
- listening on 7775 for enrolment-store-proxy requests
- listening on 9904 for des requests
- listening on 8100 for datastream events

You can switch this behaviour off by setting `proxies.start` config property to `false`.

## Data Model
Every stubbed user and other data live in some test sandbox (planet). 
You have to declare existing or a new planet whenever you sign-in. Each authenticated session have planetId information. 
Stubbed and custom UIs will consider only users and data assigned to the current planet.

User authentication expires after 15 minutes and so does the bearer token.
All users and other data on each planet are removed after 12h unless marked as permanent.
