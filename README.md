# Agents External Stubs

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/_latestVersion)

This microservice is part of Agent Services local testing framework, 
providing dynamic stubs for 3rd party upstream services.

You will have to run [UI stubs](https://github.com/hmrc/agents-external-stubs-frontend) as well in order to be able to sign-in seamlessly into your application.

This app SHOULD NOT be run on QA nor Production environment.

## How requests to the stubbed APIs are handled?

To handle requests aimed at stubbed API microservices we provide necessary TCP proxies:

- listening on 8500 for auth requests
- listening on 9337 for citizen-details requests

You can switch this behaviour off by setting `proxies.start` config property to `false`.

## Data Model
Every stubbed user and other data live on some test planet. 
You have to declare existing or a new planet whenever you sign-in. Each authenticated session have planetId information. 
Stubbed and custom APIs will consider only users and data assigned to this planet.

## Stubbed APIs

## Running the tests

    sbt test it:test

## Running the tests with coverage

    sbt clean coverageOn test it:test coverageReport

## Running the app locally

    sm --start AGENTS_EXTERNAL_STUBS -f

or

    sbt run

It should then be listening on ports 9009 and 8500

    browse http://localhost:9009/
